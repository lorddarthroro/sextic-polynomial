# sextic-polynomial
Code to search for sextic counterexample to Euler's sum of powers conjecture

I plan to go back and use some heuristics and math to try to simplify and expedite the code, but I mostly just wanted to get started on this project as it just felt like  something that would be fun to try out

Edit: I added a euclid_power_conjecture method that uses some math revolving around calculating error that I thought might yield responses if answers exist.
